# Answering-Business-Questions-using-SQL
The project focuses on new techniques to work with the sort of databases that most businesses will use.
It is based on a modified version of a database called [Chinnok](https://github.com/lerocha/chinook-database).The Chinook database contains information about a fictional digital music shop - kind of like a mini-iTunes store.
The Chinook database contains information about the artists, songs, and albums from the music shop, as well as information on the shop's employees, customers, and the customers purchases. This information is contained in eleven tables. 
Using SQL some Business questions are answered(Refer chinook.ipynb).
